## Introduction
Welcome to the Spring Boot MVC Project! This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Spring Boot framework in creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

Spring Boot simplifies the development of web applications by providing a range of features and tools that streamline configuration and deployment. This project showcases how to leverage these features to build a fully functional web application.

Key features of this project include:
- Spring Boot Integration: Utilizes the Spring Boot framework to create a standalone, production-ready application.
- MVC Architecture: Implements the MVC pattern to separate concerns, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.
- RESTful APIs: Exposes RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with front-end clients.
- Data Persistence: Integrates with a database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and key components. Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to Spring Boot, this project serves as a valuable resource to understand and implement Spring Boot MVC applications.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven 3.2+ (if using Maven) or Gradle 4+ (if using Gradle)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL (or another supported database)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sushil-18/SpringBoot-MVC-Week2.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SpringBoot-MVC-Week2

3. Configure the database connection in application.properties:
   ```bash
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

4. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
